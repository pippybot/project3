			<h1> Some fun facts about me </h1>

			<p>I played percussion for about eight years starting in 5th grade all the way to my senior year of high school</p>
			<p>I am a general manager at a Little Caesar's near my hometown. I moved back home for the Spring 2024 semester so I could do school and work full-time</p>
			<p>I am also really into video games and do a lot of esports in whatever free time I manage to create</p>

			<h2>Tattoo Pictures</h2>
			<p>I have three tattoos. Since I am a huge nerd, of course I had to get something to show it off.</p>
			<p>The first picture is my "Nerdy Hallows" tattoo. The second one is my half sleeve, my newest/newer tattoo that I got in early March.</p>
			<div class="slideshow">
				<div class="slideshow-images">
					<img class="slider-image" src="images/NerdyHallows.jpg" alt="Picture of my 'Nerdy Hallows' tattoo that I designed myself." id="slide">

					<button id="nextBtn">Next</button>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The last tattoo I have is two hearts that meet in the middle to create an infinity loop. It was the very first tattoo I got.</p>
			<p>I don't have a picture of it, but this tattoo I got matching with my mom. It represents that no matter what happens between us that we will always love each other</p>
			<p>It ended up being a Mother's Day gift to her in 2021. I asked her what she would want for Mother's Day and when she said 'nothing', I suggested matching tattoos.</p>
