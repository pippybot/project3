		<h1>These are my dogs!</h1>
		<sub>I have two dogs - Loki and Bailey</sub>
		<section id="loki">
		  <p>This is Loki! We got him in 2021 after our black lab passed. He was a total ball of mischief, hence the name Loki. He is our dog of mischief: </p>

		  <p>My mother always talks about how she doesn't like the dog, which is totally not true. You can tell with this picture of him laying on her bed.</p>

		  <p>That same picture is the background of her work monitor.</p>

		<section id="bailey">
		  <p>This is Bailey! We got her last summer on a whim. She is a total goofball of a dog and barks a TON: </p>

		  <p>She is the second female dog I have had in my life</p>
		</section>
	
		<section id="izzy">
		  <p>This is Isabella, or we called her Izzy: </p>
		  <img src="images/izzycoat.png" alt="Picture of Izzy in her coat on a walk" width="400" height="500" />
		  <p>We had Izzy for about 12 years. This past January she became sick, and overnight into the big snow storm day, she passed in her sleep.</p>
		  <p>Izzy was a chihuahua weiner dog mix. We called her the 'Burnt Sausage that was left on the grill for too long'.</p>

		<section id="three-dogateers">
		  <img src="images/threedogateers.jpg" alt="Picture of the three pooches on the steps." width="1020" height="550" />
		  <p>The three of them loved spending time outside in the sun, and who doesn't, really?</p>
